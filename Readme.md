Section 1 to 3 (10 april):(Done)

Section 4 to 6 (11 april):(Done)

Appendix 9.1 to 9,3 (12 april) (Done)

Understand the code for paper1, i.e the pipeline for CREMA-D evaluation dataset, and SER.(Done)

Plan ahead(23 April):

1) Go through dimensionality reduction methods SVD, PCA, and LDA(Done)

 GRP, KPCA and Autoencoders(Single-hiddle layer)(TODO)

2) Create environment for the pipeline.(TODO)

3) We will go through pipeline and run it end-to-end on gpu. (TODO)

4) Modify the pipeline for SER and use multiple PTM's((TODO)) from huggingface. (TODO)

5) Apply dimensionality reduction methods learned above in the SER pipeline.(TODO)

6) Code walkthrough for paper2.(TODO)
